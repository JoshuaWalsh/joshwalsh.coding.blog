I am a software developer living in Sydney, Australia. I enjoy programming for the sake of it, so a lot of my projects
are based on whims instead of any practical need. This is reflected in my blog posts, which often talk about projects
that may seem pointless, ill-advised or Byzantine. But I hope you'll find them as entertaining
and educational as I did.

This blog will contain a curated subset of posts from my [main blog](https://blog.joshwalsh.me/). I will be sharing
posts that I think are particularly interesting here.
